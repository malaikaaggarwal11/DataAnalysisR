# Data Analysis Project
Welcome to my repository!
This repositiry includes R script for the code, a folder for graphs, a pdf of the final data report, an excel file for the data set. 
The objective was to study how factors like expenditure, infant mortality rate, and immunization against diseases affect Life Expectancy.
I used this data set to analyse causal relationships between Life Expectancy and various dependent variables like schooling, Aids, Polio, GDP etc. The data set shows a 15-year (2000-2015) trend for 193 countries and islands.
I expected to find that a greater schooling ( number of years of education), expenditure, GDP increase Life Expectancy. On the contrary, variables like Alcohol intake, infant mortality reduce number of years from a persons life. The data set also includes immunisation programs for various life threatening diseases in these countries.
